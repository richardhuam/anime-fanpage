# Anime Fan Page

This is an anime fan page built with TypeScript, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. It provides a platform for anime enthusiasts to explore, discover, and discuss their favorite anime series and movies.

## Features

- Browse a collection of popular anime titles
- Search for specific anime by title, genre, or keyword
- View detailed information about each anime, including synopsis, rating, and airing status

## Technologies Used

- TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances development experience and code quality.
- Next.js: A React framework for building server-rendered React applications with easy setup and built-in routing.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for building modern and responsive user interfaces.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
